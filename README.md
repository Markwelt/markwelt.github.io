This is my attempt at a personal academic website with Github. The site is located [here](https://markwelt.github.io).

I expect major (static) changes to the underlying structure as soon as I have time. For now, this looks very similar to the forked template kindly available at [academicpages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou) (so get it there), itself based on the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), which is Â© 2016 Michael Rose and released under the MIT License.
